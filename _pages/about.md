Welcome! I'm a recent M.Sc. graduate in Machine Learning and Computer Vision from the Australian National University, specialized in 3D reconstruction. My journey in computer science began at the University of Alberta, where I earned my B.Sc. (Specialization) with a focus on Background Subtraction and Moving Objects Tracking under Prof. Anup Basu. 
At ANU, under the supervision of Prof. Hongdong Li, I deepened my expertise in Computer Vision, culminating in a thesis on indoor-scene 3D reconstruction. My passion lies in advancing the field of Computer Vision through innovative research and practical applications.
