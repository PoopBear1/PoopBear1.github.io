Welcome! I am an incoming PhD student in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at the Australian National University, my research field focuses on multi-modal learning. I recently completed my master's degree specialized in 3D reconstruction. My journey in computer science began at the University of Alberta, where I earned my B.Sc. (Specialization) with a focus on Background Subtraction and Moving Objects Tracking under Prof. Anup Basu. At ANU, under the supervision of Prof. Hongdong Li, I deepened my expertise in Computer Vision, culminating in a thesis on indoor-scene 3D reconstruction. My passion lies in advancing Computer Vision through innovative research and practical applications.
